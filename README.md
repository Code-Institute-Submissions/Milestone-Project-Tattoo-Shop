## METAMORPHOSIS TATTOO SHOP OF TIVERTON

A local Tattoo shop wanted to upgrade there current webpage to increase client base, by providing better visual 
representationthat not only showcases the art work the shop have done but to also capture your attention as soon
as you open the webpage, making the client want to re-visit the site and tell others to visit it for there tattoos
too.

## Features

- *Navbar* holds the title of the shop and links to the gallery and contact page that is constant across all of them which
follows users as you scroll down the page making swapping between pages much easier and quicker.

- *Hero-image* is very large and very eye catching image of the shop owner tattoing a customer. Taking up most of the 
viewport as you open the webpage making it clear what the website is about. It is the same for the gallery page but the picture is
of a painting the shop owner has painted himself showing off his talents to the users.

- *About us* section gives a background story into the shop and Sam the shop owner. The shop logo (branding) is used to help make
the shop more recognisable. 

- *Recent work* section is images showcasing a number of different tattoos, in different styles and themes to help users/ potential 
clients see the quality of work the shop do and to help users/ clients see options they can use for there own designs.

- *Testimonials* section has comments from previous and current customers that have had great experiences getting there tattoos 
from Sam at his shop. This could help anyone who is unsure/ undecided on whether to get there tattoo from here or someone else.

- *Footer* holds links to social network websites facebook and instagram that users to the site can click on and view more stuff 
the shop has posted like images or even deals on tattoos etc. This is also constant across all the pages making them easier to
access.

- *Gallery* has multiple sub-headings of different tattoo style names Sam carries out and showcases a number of those images in
that particular style.

- *Contact page* has general contact information like the address, phone number, email address and opening times. There is a 
simple form the user can fill out and send off to the shop to get a price guide or ask about any general enquiry they may have.

### Existing Features

### In the furture I would like to implement the following features

    1. A banner advertising gift cards and after care products the studio offer.

    2. Animation to the hero image to capture users attention and so the site isnt so static.

    3. A more attractive grid system to display the images.

    4. Showcase more styles of tattoos, larger gallery.

    5. Have a more interactive gallery, where you would need to click on the style of tattoo sub-heading which would open 
    the images inside.

    6. Be able to look at a picture closer by getting an enlarged view of the image once you have clicked on it.

    7. have more customer testimonials scrolling accross the screen.

    8. In the form add a upload section so customers can send there own designs or images they have found to the studio
    for more accurate pricing and to be worked on to make them more unique.
