    the images inside.

7. Have more customer testimonials scrolling across the screen.

8. In the form add an upload section so customers can send their own designs or images they have found to the studio
    for more accurate pricing and to be worked on to make them more unique.

## __Testing__

### __User story testing__

#### __As a user to the Metamorphosis Tattoo Studio website I:__

1. __Need the website to be laid out in a way that makes it easy for me to navigate and find what I need quickly.__
    - Arrange the site so that elements like the navbar, footer, icons, images and contact form are in the expected places.
    - All pages can be accessed from the navbar that is constantly fixed to the top of the screen and clearly indentified,
    following you as you move down the structure of the website making it easy to jump back to any page you need.

2. __Need the information I see on the site to make sense, easy to to understand so it is ok for me to digest.__
    - Arrange the information so that the more important stuff is prioritised, not over complicated so that the user can 
    digest the information they are more interested in firstly and easily.
    - Clear headings of the sections on each page and images help digest the information quickly.

3. __Need to know more about the studio owner and artist, so that I can trust them with a carrying out my tattoo.__
    - The about me sections provides a brief history into the studio and its owner with enough information, without overloading
    them to build confidence in the user on getting a tattoo from them.
    - The testimonial section provides even more reassurance in the user with feedback from customers who have used the services
    provided by the studio. Icons are used along side the text to help make the information easier to digest.

4. __Need information and the images to be laid out so they are simple to navigate on what ever device I'm using.__
    - I used a very simple lay out for the images with enough spacing between each, making it clear and precise that works on all
    devices.
    - Information text is never to large or small, icons and buttons are large enough to see what they are clearly and click on.

5. __Expect the website to be easy to navigate on whatever device I am using.__
    - A lot of attention was put into making sure the website looked as similar as possible on all devives producing wireframes first
    and working from them.
    - Responsive elements were used to achieve the consitent feel across all viewports.
    - All pages have been simulated on desktop, tablet and phone screen sizes to verify the responsiveness of the website.

6. __Want to be able to connect to the studio's social media sites to keep update to date with any recent news or deals.__
    - The footer contains links to the studios social media sites on Facebook and Instagram.
    - The links once clicked open the social media pages in a seperate window tab and are clearly indentified using the appropriate 
    icons.

7. __Expect to be able to get in touch with the studio via a contact form or by phone easily.__
    - The navbar is clearly marked with a *Contact Us* page and is accessible at all times.
    - From the *Conatct us* page all the relevant information on how to get in touch with the studio are available and clear.
    - The contact us form is very simple, easy to understand and gives clear precise information on missed input fields.

## __Bugs__

### __Solved bugs__

1. __Hero image,__
    - My original image I was planning on using wouldn't stretch the full width of the container width.
    - I tried using css styling like the following but the image would not fill the whole space.

        * #hero-image {
        * height: 600px;
        * width: 100%;
        * background: url("../images/main-image.jpeg");
        * background-position: center;
        * background-repeat: no-repeat;
        * background-size: cover;
        * }

    - After contacting the slack community and the Code Institute tutors, I realised the image sizing was the problem.
    - To solve this issue, I had to find a larger image.

2. __Contact form,__
    - I used the the bootstrap classes to input my contact form at first which was fine and worked an aligned central to the page.
    - Once i added some css styling to the elements to make it my own the form would only align to the left of the page.
    - To solve this bug I decided to write out my own form from scratch and add the bootstrap classes i wanted after.

3. __Navbar toggler icon,__
    - On desktop viewport the navbar looks as intended, but when I inspected the page on a smaller device my nav links didn't change
    to a burger icon like I wanted.
    - To solve this I watched youtube videos and google searches to find correct bootstrap class inputs.
    * [bootstrap Navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/)
    * [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42586729/bootstrap-4-change-hamburger-toggler-color)

4. __Colour scheme of website,__
    - I intended on using the colours in the shop logo but after a couple reviews I was informed that it affected the UX.
    - To solve this I decided to use one colour throughout the website and use a bit of the red to breakup sections of the site.

5. __Footer,__
    - Information overload in the footer with the opening times and contact info.
    - As this information was going to be repeated on the *Contact Us* page I decided to only put the social links, making the UX 
    more pleasing.

### __Unsolved bugs__

1. __Contact form email and phone input,__
    - While testing the contact form I noticed that I would get a input required message if no email address was entered, but 
    do not get an error message if the email has been entered incorrectly (i.e. murv121@hotmial.co.uk) didn't pick up that the "a" and 
    the "i" were the wrong way round. This is the same for a phone number, any numbers can be added and be accepted.
    - I have tried to find the solution to this on bootstrap and google but unable to find one that worked.

2. __Contact form successful pop-up message,__
    - After filling in all the relevant required fields to complete the form and clicked on the *Send* button, I wanted a pop-up
    message saying "Thank You! & Your details have been successfully sent.".
        - I tried to use bootstraps *alerts* inputs but all I got was a seperate section below the button saying "thank You!".
        - Also tried to input a modal which did work once you had clicked on the *Send* button but was unable to close the modal
        down using the close buttons.
